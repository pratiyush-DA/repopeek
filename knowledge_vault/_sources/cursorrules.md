# Project Identity
This project is a Repository Intelligence / Semantic Code Graph system. It builds a queryable graph combining deterministic code relationships (extracted directly from source) with semantic/business understanding (inferred by AI) to act as a persistent memory layer for AI coding agents.

# Agent Operating Rules
1. Read `docs/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md` before implementing features.
2. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before changing architecture.
3. Read `docs/graph_schema.json` before changing graph structures.
4. Read `docs/TASKS.md` before beginning implementation work.
5. Work ONLY on the current active task in `TASKS.md` before starting unrelated improvements.
6. Avoid implementing future-phase functionality.
7. Avoid introducing infrastructure that is outside the MVP.
8. **Anti-Hallucination Rule:** If a behavior, schema field, dependency, architecture decision, or product requirement is not documented or directly inferable from existing code, do not invent it. Mark it as "TBD" or ask for clarification.
9. Preserve the strict separation between deterministic facts (code substrate) and LLM-inferred semantics (business overlay).
10. Keep graph relationships consistent with `graph_schema.json`.
11. Prefer simple, local implementations for the MVP.
12. Do not rewrite working components unnecessarily.
13. Do not change the architecture merely because another technology might be more sophisticated.
14. Update documentation when an explicitly approved architectural decision changes the implementation.

# Scope Protection
The agent must NEVER automatically turn the MVP into:
- A SaaS platform or cloud service.
- A distributed graph system (e.g., Neo4j, Memgraph).
- A multi-language code intelligence platform (beyond the approved MVP languages).
- An enterprise security platform.
- A full coding IDE.
- A replacement for existing coding agents.
